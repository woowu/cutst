CU-Z62 Q189-F11 Testing

# Definition of F11?

- New F11 on meter LCD (if previous one cleared before testing)
- Last backup copy of data were inserted into profile
- Recorded energy measures dropped at the profile insertion point
- A related event found in event log (optional)

# ATS Fixtures

## Using FFC3

## Test Programs 

dlt645tst
: Python script that do DLT645 communication with CU, its behavior
are simulations to the in-field data concentrators (Weisheng and Keli)

xdlms
: FFC3 meter reading program that talks DLMS protocol with meter/cu. It
read meter registers, profiles, events and clock

# Test Findings
## Bad DLMS APDU

FFC3 can see a very strange dlms response that contains
a corrupted DLMS apdu encapsulated in a valid HDLC frame.
This *possibly* means meter DLMS tx buffer damaged. Below
are detail log locations:

| Meter         | Log              | Excerpt                                     |
|---------------|------------------|---------------------------------------------|

By far, this kind of traffics were observed only in CU's 
DLMS RS485 ports, *not yet* observed in base meter's RS485
ports.

# Open Points

- Why CU-Z62's SPI has its MISO pin as high level when in idle mode?
    - It *probably* due to some incorrectly setting of the M16C SI/O
    registers, also *possibly* due to MISO need to keep its last data
    for half-clock time. It need to read more M16C documents to 
    understand it.
- Why CU-Z62's SPI has only half speed comparing to CU-U52 and CU-B4
    - Woody ask: What is the MCU running speed of CU-Z62 and CU-U52?
    - Woody ask: Can I get a full timing capture of the S0 communication
    instance? The previous one is not set in the same time scale for CU-Z62
    and CU-U52/B4, hence I cannot tell in what protocol stage the time
    is used.
    - Woody plan to draw a timing and state-machine diagram for the behavior
    of CU-Z62's MCO/SPI module.
- How CU-Z62 protect its four app task from race conditions?
    - This is important. But yet to study.
